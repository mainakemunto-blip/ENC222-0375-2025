Write C++ data structure pseudocode; Selection & iteration statements
•	Pseudocode is a simple human readable way of writing an algorithm that looks like a programming code but does not follow the strict rules of any programming language
•	Data structure is a specific way to organize, store and manage data in a computer for efficient access and modification defining data values, their relationships and operations that can be performed
•	Selection statement allows the program to make decisions and execute certain code based on conditions i.e. true or false
•	Iteration statement allows a program to repeat a block of code multiple times

1.	Data structure using user defined data type structure
START

Struct Car
    integer milage
    string type
    string model
ENDSTRUCT

Declare myCar as Car
read myCar.milage = 200
read myCar.type = "Toyota"
read myCar.model = "Corolla"

Display "My car is a " + myCar.type + " with model " + myCar.model + " and a milage of" + myCar.milage

2.	Selection statement using if else
if myCar.milage > 200 then
    display "the car is economical."
else
    display "the car is not economical."
ENDIF

3.	Iteration statement using for loop
Display "repeating car type 5 times"
for a from 0 to 4
display myCar.type
ENDFOR

END




PYTHON STYLE:

START

Create class Car
    milage
    type
    model

myCar = Car
myCar.milage = 200
myCar.type = "Toyota"
myCar.model = "Corolla"

Display "My car is a", myCar.type,
        "with model", myCar.model,
        "and a milage of", myCar.milage

# selection statement
IF myCar.milage > 200:
    Display "the car is economical"
ELSE:
    Display "the car is not economical"

# iteration statement
Display "repeating car type 5 times"

FOR a = 1 TO 5
    Display myCar.type

END
